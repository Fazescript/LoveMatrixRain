# ❤️ Matrix Particle Bloom - High-End Canvas Animation
A sophisticated, cinematic web experience that blends the iconic "Matrix Digital Rain" aesthetic with advanced particle physics. This project features a seamless transition from a code-sweep effect to an exploding particle countdown, ending in a beautiful, pulsating heart ripple animation.

# 🌟 Key Features
Matrix Sweep Intro: A custom-rendered "Matrix" rain effect using romantic characters, featuring a vertical scanline transition.

Dynamic Particle Morphing: Particles that intelligently morph into text ("3, 2, 1", "You", "Are", "My", "Love") and eventually a heart shape.

Explosion Physics: Realistic velocity-based explosion effects between text transitions for a high-impact cinematic feel.

Heart Ripple System: Continuous mathematical heart-shaped ripples generated using Bezier curves and parametric equations.

Fully Responsive: The entire canvas and particle density adapt perfectly to any screen resolution or window resize.

# 🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5 Canvas: For high-performance, frame-by-frame 2D rendering.

Advanced Vanilla JavaScript: * OOP: Custom Particle class to manage individual behaviors.

Async Logic: Uses async/await and Promises to coordinate the animation sequence.

Parametric Math: Uses complex math for heart outlines and particle drifting.

# 🖥 Local Setup
